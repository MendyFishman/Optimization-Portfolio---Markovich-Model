Optimization Portfolio - Maximizing Profits while Minimizing Risk by Markovich Model

## Introductoin:
In the world of finance, making informed investment decisions is crucial. Model Markovich aims to address this challenge by providing an optimization model that helps investors maximize their profit potential while minimizing risk. This project incorporates various techniques (Short and Long) to achieve this goal.

## Features:
- Portfolio Optimization: Utilize mathematical optimization techniques to construct an optimal portfolio based on your preferences for risk and return.
- Data Analysis: Explore historical financial data and perform statistical analysis to inform your investment decisions.
- Visualization: Visualize portfolio performance, risk, and return to gain deeper insights

## Files:
There are three files:
1. Maximum_Return.m - Matlab code, The goal of the program is to find the investment portfolio that maximizes the return according to the risk that the client is willing to take.
2. Minimum_Risk.m - Matlab code, The goal of the program is to find the investment portfolio that minimizes risk according to the return that the client seeks to achieve.
3. RiskAversion.m - Matlab code, Integrated model depending on the client's utility function.
